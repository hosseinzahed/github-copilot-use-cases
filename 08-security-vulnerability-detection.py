# A simple Python script to demonstrate how to make a POST request to an API

import requests
import json


# Sample API endpoint
url = "https://api.example.com/weahter"

# Sample payload
payload = {
    "project": "sample_project",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}

# Sample headers
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "API-Key": "c59d170b-f8ac-495e-b83d-cfea5958f238"
}

# Make a POST request to the API
response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Weather data retrieved successfully.")
    # Parse the JSON response
    
        
# Prompt: Perform a security check
